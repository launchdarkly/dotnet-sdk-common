# LaunchDarkly SDK .NET Common Code

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/LaunchDarkly.CommonSdk.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LaunchDarkly.CommonSdk/)
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-sdk-common.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/dotnet-sdk-common)

This project contains .NET classes and interfaces that are shared between the LaunchDarkly .NET and Xamarin SDKs. Code that is specific to one or the other is in [dotnet-server-sdk](https://github.com/launchdarkly/dotnet-server-sdk) or [xamarin-client-sdk](https://github.com/launchdarkly/xamarin-client-sdk).

It also contains the optional add-on package [`LaunchDarkly.CommonSdk.JsonNet`](./src/LaunchDarkly.CommonSdk.JsonNet/README.md), which makes it easier to use LaunchDarkly types with the popular Json.NET library.

## About LaunchDarkly

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
